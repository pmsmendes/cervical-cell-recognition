# Cervical Cell Recognition
This study uses machine learning techniques to automate cervical cell classification, making the diagnosis faster and more accurate.
It uses the SIPaKMeD dataset, which includes 4049 labeled images of cervical cells across five different types: dyskeratotic, koilocytotic, metaplastic, parabasal and superficial-intermediate.
Three machine learning models were applied - A custom CNN, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to predict cell types.
This work provides insight into how machine learning can help improve cervical cancer diagnosis and make early detection more accessible.
